the `INSERT_PLOTLY_USERNAME` and `INSERT_PLOTLY_API_KEY` values from `https://plot.ly/settings/api`.

SpreadSheetID can be found by looking at the URL for the spreadsheet and finding: d/`<SpreadSheetID>`/edit


#### OAuthClientSecretJSON
This is generated for you by google :) just log in at `https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials` and set up a project, and add a service account with permissions and download the json file.
More info can be found here: `https://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2.html`
You will need to add the `Sheets API` and maybe the `Drive API` to the project from the developer console. 

Copy the JSON File into creds.json.
